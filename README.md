The following files are used to create and configure virtual machines on a Proxmox server:

main.tf: This is the main Terraform configuration file, where you define the resources you want to create or manage. In this example, it contains the resource "proxmox_vm" block, which creates the virtual machines on the Proxmox server.

variables.tf: This file contains the input variables that are used in the main.tf configuration file. These variables allow you to set the values for different aspects of the virtual machines, such as their names, memory size, number of vCPUs, and storage.

provider.tf: This file configures the Terraform provider, which is the connection between Terraform and the Proxmox server. It includes the endpoint, username and password of the Proxmox server.

*.tfvars: This file contains the values of the input variables defined in the variables.tf file. This file is not necessary, you can also set variable values using CLI or environment variables.

When these files are used together, they allow you to create and configure virtual machines on a Proxmox server using Terraform. By setting the values of the input variables in the variables.tf file and/or the .tfvars file, you can easily create and manage multiple virtual machines with different configurations, as well as keep the provider configuration separate from the rest of your Terraform code.

So, you can use Terraform to define the virtual machine resources, and use the variables and tfvars files to set the values for those resources, like for example, the number of vCPUs, memory, storage, etc.

When you run terraform apply command, Terraform will create the virtual machines on the Proxmox server according to the configurations defined in the main.tf file and the values set in the variables and tfvars files.
